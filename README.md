# Stone, Paper, Scissors Image Classification

This project demonstrates image classification of stone, paper, and scissor using a machine learning model trained with Teachable Machine, provided by Google. The code creates a simple web interface where users can activate their webcam and see real-time predictions of the model.

## How to Use
1. Click the "Start" button to initialize the webcam.
2. Hold up an object (stone, paper, or scissor) in front of the webcam.
3. The model will predict the class of the object and display the result.

## Dependencies
- TensorFlow.js
- Teachable Machine Image

## How to Run
1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open the HTML file in a web browser.
3. Follow the instructions provided in the web interface.

## Credits
- This project is based on the Teachable Machine Image by Google Creative Lab.
